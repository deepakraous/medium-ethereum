# Ethereum Under the Hood: Part-1 (ver 0.4)

This series will follow my journey into exploring Ethereum from the ground up. I am assuming that you have some knowledge of programming to understand some but not all of the concepts. Note, I will be updating this post will multiple versions with additional information as I see fit.

**World Computer : The Ethereum Blockchain**

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) is a complex piece of software mixed in with g[ame theory/economics](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/cryptocurrency-game-theory/). it can be mind-boggling If you are trying to understand what’s going on underneath and sometimes tiresome. I found it difficult to find resources to understand the specifications. Instead of finding one I thought of writing one.

A good way to understand Ethereum is to understand the definition as mentioned in the [white](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper), [beige](https://github.com/chronaeon/beigepaper/blob/master/beigepaper.pdf), [yellow](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper) papers. All of these papers point to the same specifications with varying details, **white** being at a higher level and **Yellow** being more detail specification. Throughout this series, we will be referring mainly from **Beige** Paper(BP) and some elements from the Yellow Paper(YP). so let us stick with BP definition for now and begin our journey.

*Tip: I would recommend you to have the [BP](https://github.com/chronaeon/beigepaper/) and [YP](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper) open as a PDF in two windows and referring to the specifications as an when needed.*

**What is Ethereum?**

Ethereum imho is a combination of a Global State and a Virtual Machine. **Ethereum = World State+Virtual Machine**.

**What is the World State?**

World State simply refers to as **The Universal truth **at a given snapshot for *this* system. Let’s look at it from a different angle, say a State Data is available, who will be using it and what can they do? hold that thought for now. Let’s look at a skeleton code for the some of the API’s available for the World State Database. Let’s assume there are two basic *function(s) *are available getGlobalState() and isValidGlobalState(), the skeleton code for the APIs might look like the code snippet below.

    *function* **getWorldState()**{
     return stateInfo ;
    }
    *function* **isValidWorldState(obj stateInfo)**{
      return true/false ;
    }

The first *function* returns the **Truth** at that point in time in other words the function returns the Current State(aka Truth). The second function verifies the if the state is correct,Meaning you can trust what you are getting and nothing has tampered. Does the next function verify if the state it has received is accurate ?. Let’s say some unknown player passes say a Current State **XYZ** and one should verify the Current State **XYZ** is accurate to use **isValidWorldState(XYZ) **and you should get **true** if not yikes! Alert Alert.

Now next comes the question? **state XYZ** must be stored in a hard drive and should be in a format recognized by another set of functions which will read and add a new state. Notice that I said read and add and not **update, **We don’t have an **update** function as almost all Blockchains are append-only and cannot modify the current state.

Let’s explore some possible *functions* for our **VM**. *According to the Yellow Paper, a VM is a subset of a State Transition Function. Have a look at the handy reference.*

***Formally: [σt+1 ≡ Υ(σt, T)](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) from the yellow paper. More details provided below***

    *function* **addNewState(obj nextState)**{ 
      verify currentState;
      newState = currentState+nextState;
      return newState;
     }

reading of the state function can look like this:

    *function* **readState(obj currentState)**{
        verify currentState;
        return nextState;
     }

**Mining** is also a part of the State Transition Function and the YP, here is a handy table I am creating to explain away the proofs.

*Tip: handy reference to the [symbols](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/6022/algebra-symbology-guidance-for-ethereum-yellow-paper) used in YP and **Appendix -A** below*

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/b90e961465d078548c29f4fd2629e9ad" frameborder=0></iframe>

We can have another *function* called **verifyState()** among other things, my point is to keep it simple, by using these state transition *functions* the simple computer aka Virtual Machine(VM) executes these instruction in those functions and ensures that everything is in order. Let me stop here and quote the** Abstract **from the B[eige-paper](https://github.com/chronaeon/beigepaper/blob/master/beigepaper/beigepaper.pdf) (BP)

“***The Ethereum Protocol is a deterministic but practically unbounded state-machine with two basic functions; the first being a globally accessible singleton state, and the second being a virtual machine that applies changes to that state**.”*

Before we move on, remember we talked about “Virtual Machine” (from the previous section ) aka “VM”. VM function verifies the World State and change the state by adding a new block. So imagine you are renting out our computer to perform some computations.

Nothing comes for free, the virtual machine cannot run some random code, the code needs to be vetted , data has to be verified and the code needs to exit carefully etc etc. So every code which needs to be run should submit a certain fee. The fee is **Ether**. Lets pause here and think about it for a while.

**What is Ether?**

So lets look back at what Ethereum is. Ethereum is a functional global computer, so to run this global computer we need to pay some network cost and that network cost unit is **Ether: **Ξ

Ξ can be broken into the following units. **Wei** (Ξ 10^-18) is the smallest unit as you can see a **Finney** can be denominated as **Wei** (Ξ 10^-03) or 0.0010000000000000000 **Ether**

What if there is no pay to play concept in Ethereum? if I was a bad actor I can easily bring down the system with one infinite loop and consume all the resources and the VM cannot execute the next instruction set. Ethereum prevents this by making people pay for it, the idea is once you pay for something you are careful and will not harm the system. I am really over simplifying the idea, but you get the drift. In the next section we will talk about what is the “Truth” aka Global State and how can you verify the Global State and what is data in the Global State

**What is this data in the *World* *State*?**

Simply put the data in World State is a state divided by blocks , each new block represent a new Global State. Blocks contain a mapping of** Addresses and Account States** using a serialization /deserialization algorithm called the [***Recursive Link Prefix(RLP)** ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP)*and stored as a [**Patricia-Merkle Trie](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Patricia-Tree) **in a Database Backend which maintains the mapping of a [Byte-array](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4019837/what-do-we-mean-by-byte-array) to Byte-array. We will delve into what is an **RLP** in the next episode.

So the World state = Total Hash of the hashes of database relationship in the State Database. I am going to stop here and stretch, I suggest you do the same.

Lets say we have a key, value pair array, LHS is the mapping of
the state, i.e Bytearray ->Bytearray. RHS is the actual mapping itself

     state 1 = [key1, val1]
     state 2 = [key2, val2]
     state 3 = [key3, val3] Global State = *hash*( [ [state1], [state2], [state3]...] )

Quoting from the yellow paper “*The state can include such information as account balances, reputations, trust arrangements, data pertaining to information of the physical world; in short, anything that can currently be represented by a computer is admissible.” .*

Remember the *functions *which we talked about and one of the parameter in those functions(s) referred to as “obj”, now lets expand “obj” a little bit, “obj” is an acronym for “Object”. An object in Ethereum world is a byte array. E.g’s of an object which is essentially a byte array.

“Dog” [“D”,”o”, “g”], [[], “Dog”, [“Cat”]]

According to BP the Bytearrays are stored in Special Format called the **Recursive Link Prefix(RLP)**. We touched on it briefly before. Lets dig a little deeper into what this **RLP** fuss is all about in the next post.

Let’s recap what we discovered this week.

1. Ethereum is a World Computer.

1. Ethereum is a **combination** of A Singular World State+A Virtual Machine

1. World State is a **Collection** of all States.

1. A **State** is a collection of **Blocks**.

1. The World State is stored as a **Patricia Merkle Trie** as per the **RLP** Prefix spec in a mini Database.

1. Only a Virtual Machine can **add** a new State.

1. The Virtual Machine needs **fuel** to execute instructions and the fuel is ‘Ether’ to prevent rogue actions.

*In the **next section** we will delve into what is **RLP and we will be using some code examples.***
